# Welcome to My Photography Blog

Hi! I'm so glad you're here. This is a space where I'll share photography tips, behind-the-scenes stories from my sessions, and inspiration from my work.

## What to Expect

Here you'll find:

- **Session highlights** — stories and photos from recent client sessions (with permission, of course)
- **Photography tips** — everything from posing advice to what to wear for your session
- **Behind the scenes** — how I approach lighting, location scouting, and editing

## My Photography Philosophy

Every person deserves photos that feel like *them* — not stiff or forced, but genuine moments captured beautifully.

When you work with me, we always start with a conversation. I want to know what makes you laugh, what you're nervous about, and what you're hoping to feel when you look at your photos years from now.

## Ready to Book?

If you'd like to work together, head over to my [scheduling page](/schedule) to check availability and book your session.

I can't wait to tell your story through photographs!
